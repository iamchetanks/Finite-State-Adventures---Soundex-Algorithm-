# Finite-State-Adventures---Soundex-Algorithm-
The Soundex algorithm is a phonetic algorithm commonly used by libraries and the Census Bureau to represent people's names as they are pronounced in English. It has the advantage that name variations with minor spelling differences will map to the same representation, as long as they have the same pronunciation in English. 

Here is how the algorithm works:
Step 1: Retain the first letter of the name. This may be uppercased or
lowercased.
Step 2: Remove all non-initial occurrences of the following letters: a, e,
h, i, o, u, w, y. (To clarify, this step removes all occurrences of
the given characters except when they occur in the first position.)
Step 3: Replace the remaining letters (except the first) with numbers:
 b, f, p, v -> 1
 c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z -> 2
 d, t -> 3
 l -> 4
 m, n -> 5
 r -> 6
If two or more letters from the same number group were adjacent in
the original name (i.e. before any letter removal is done), then only
replace the first of those letters with the corresponding number and
ignore the others.
Step 4: If there are more than 3 digits in the resulting output, then drop
the extra ones.
Step 5: If there are less than 3 digits, then pad at the end with the required
number of trailing zeros.
The final output of applying Soundex algorithm to any input string
should be of the form Letter Digit Digit Digit.

1. Transducer 1: Performs steps 1-3 of the algorithm, i.e, retaining the
first letter, removing letters and replacing letters with numbers.
2. Transducer 2: Performs step 4 of the algorithm, i.e., truncating extra
digits.
3. Transducer 3: Performs step 5 of the algorithm, i.e., padding with
zeros if required.
